## Host formats

Hosts may be either hostnames (for IPv4 or IPv6) or IP addresses. IPv6
addresses must be surrounded by brackets and may include a zone after the %
character. Examples:

Type            | Example
--------------- | -------
IPv4 IP         | 192.168.1.10
IPv6 IP         | [2001:db8:8f::2/32]
IPv4/6 hostname | localhost

**Note:** IPv6 addresses must be quoted in most shells.

## Duration units

Durations are a sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction, and
unit suffix, such as: "300ms", "1m30s" or "2.5m". Sanity not enforced.

Suffix | Unit
------ | ----
h      | hours
m      | minutes
s      | seconds
ms     | milliseconds
ns     | nanoseconds

# OUTPUT

IRTT's JSON output format consists of five top-level objects:

1. [version](#version)
2. [system_info](#system_info)
3. [config](#config)
4. [stats](#stats)
5. [round_trips](#round_trips)

These are documented through the examples below. All attributes are present
unless otherwise **noted**.

## version

version information

```
"version": {
    "irtt": "0.9.0",
    "protocol": 1,
    "json_format": 1
},
```

- *irtt* the IRTT version number
- *protocol* the protocol version number (increments mean incompatible changes)
- *json_format* the JSON format number (increments mean incompatible changes)

## system_info

a few basic pieces of system information

```
"system_info": {
    "os": "darwin",
    "cpus": 8,
    "go_version": "go1.9.2",
    "hostname": "tron.local"
},
```

- *os* the Operating System from Go's *runtime.GOOS*
- *cpus* the number of CPUs reported by Go's *runtime.NumCPU()*, which reflects
  the number of logical rather than physical CPUs. In the example below, the
	number 8 is reported for a Core i7 (quad core) with hyperthreading (2 threads
	per core).
- *go_version* the version of Go the executable was built with
- *hostname* the local hostname

	flag)
- *fill_one* whether to fill only once and repeat for all packets
  (irtt client *\--fill-one* flag)
- *thread_lock* whether to lock packet handling goroutines to OS threads
- *supplied* a nested *config* object with the configuration as
  originally supplied to the API or *irtt* command. The supplied configuration can
	differ from the final configuration in the following ways:
	- *local_address* and *remote_address* may have hostnames or named ports before
	  being resolved to an IP and numbered port
	- *ip_version* may be IPv4+6 before it is determined after address resolution
	- *params* may be different before the server applies restrictions based on
		its configuration

	out-of-order packets)
- *wait* the actual time spent waiting for final packets, in nanoseconds
- *duration* the actual duration of the test, in nanoseconds, from the time just
	before the first packet was sent to the time after the last packet was

   **(available regardless of whether server timestamps are enabled or not)**
- *server_processing_time* a duration stats object for the time the server took
   after it received the packet to when it sent the response **(only available
   when both send and receive timestamps are enabled)**
- *timer_err_percent* the mean of the absolute values of the timer error, as a
	percentage of the interval
- *timer_misses* the number of times the timer missed the interval (was at least
	50% over the scheduled time)

	calculated using the number of UDP payload bytes received between the time right
	after the first receive call and the time right after the last receive call

## round_trips

each round-trip is a single request to / reply from the server

**Note:** *wall* values are from Go's *time.Time.UnixNano()*, the number of nanoseconds
elapsed since January 1, 1970 UTC

**Note:** *monotonic* values are the number of nanoseconds since some arbitrary
point in time, so can only be relied on to measure duration

- *seqno* the sequence number
- *lost* the lost status of the packet, which can be one of *false*, *true*,
  *true_down* or *true_up*. The *true_down* and *true_up* values are only
  possible if the *ReceivedStats* parameter includes *ReceivedStatsWindow*
  (irtt client *\--stats* flag). Even then, if it could not be determined whether
  the packet was lost upstream or downstream, the value *true* is used.
- *timestamps* the client and server timestamps
  - *client* the client send and receive wall and monotonic timestamps
    **(*receive* values only present if *lost* is false)**
  - *server* the server send and receive wall and monotonic timestamps **(both
		*send* and *receive* values not present if *lost* is true)**, and
		additionally:
    - *send* values are not present if the StampAt (irtt client *\--tstamp* flag)
      does not include send timestamps
    - *receive* values are not present if the StampAt (irtt client *\--tstamp*
      flag) does not include receive timestamps
    - *wall* values are not present if the Clock (irtt client *\--clock* flag) does
      not include wall values or server timestamps are not enabled
    - *monotonic* values are not present if the Clock (irtt client *\--clock*
      flag) does not include monotonic values or server timestamps are not enabled
- *delay* an object containing the delay values
  - *receive* the one-way receive delay, in nanoseconds **(present only if
    server timestamps are enabled and at least one wall clock value is
		available)**
  - *rtt* the round-trip time, in nanoseconds, always present
  - *send* the one-way send delay, in nanoseconds **(present only if server
    timestamps are enabled and at least one wall clock value is available)**
- *ipdv* an object containing the
  [IPDV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_delay_variation) values
  **(attributes present only for *seqno* > 0, and if *lost* is *false* for both
  the current and previous *round_trip*)**
	- *receive* the difference in receive delay relative to the previous packet
    **(present only if at least one server timestamp is available)**
	- *rtt* the difference in round-trip time relative to the previous packet
    (always present for *seqno* > 0)
	- *send* the difference in send delay relative to the previous packet
    **(present only if at least one server timestamp is available)**

# EXIT STATUS

*irtt client* exits with one of the following status codes:

Code | Meaning
---- | -------
0    | Success
1    | Runtime error
2    | Command line error
3    | Two interrupt signals received

# WARNINGS

It is possible with the irtt client to dramatically harm network performance
by using intervals that are too low, particularly in combination with large
packet lengths. Careful consideration should be given before using
sub-millisecond intervals, not only because of the impact on the network, but
also because:

- Timer accuracy at sub-millisecond intervals may begin to suffer without
  the use of a custom kernel or the busy timer (which pins the CPU)
- Memory consumption for results storage and system CPU time both rise rapidly
- The granularity of the results reported may very well not be required

# EXAMPLES

$ irtt client localhost
:   Sends requests once per second for one minute to localhost.

$ irtt client -i 200ms -d 10s -o - localhost
:   Sends requests every 0.2 sec for 10 seconds to localhost. Writes JSON
    output to stdout.

$ irtt client -i 20ms -d 1m -l 172 \--fill=rand \--sfill=rand 192.168.100.10
:   Sends requests every 20ms for one minute to 192.168.100.10. Fills both the
    client and server payload with random data. This simulates a G.711 VoIP
    conversation, one of the most commonly used codecs for VoIP as of this
    writing.

$ irtt client -i 0.1s -d 5s -6 \--dscp=46 irtt.example.org
:   Sends requests with IPv6 every 100ms for 5 seconds to irtt.example.org.
    Sets the DSCP value (ToS field) of requests and responses to 46
    (Expedited Forwarding).

$ irtt client \--hmac=secret -d 10s "[2001:db8:8f::2/32]:64381"
:   Sends requests to the specified IPv6 IP on port 64381 every second for
    10 seconds. Adds an HMAC to each packet with the key *secret*.
